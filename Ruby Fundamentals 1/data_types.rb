# Ruby Primitive Data Types

# 1. Strings
# Single-quoted strings are simpler and best used when you need a string exactly as it is.
'Hello Ruby World'
# Double-quoted strings are more flexible and allow for escape sequences and string interpolation. 
# Escape sequences are special characters that are preceded by a backslash (\) to denote a special meaning. 
# For example, \n represents a newline character, \t represents a tab, and \\ represents a backslash.
"Hello Ruby World"
name = "Ruby"
puts "Hello, #{name}!\nWelcome to programming!"

# 2. Numbers
# Integer
42
# Float
42.3

# 3. Boolean
